# Obsidian Study Notes – Learning in Public

This repository contains my **personal Obsidian vault**, where I document concepts, experiments, and learnings while studying and building projects.

The intent is to demonstrate:
- Strong fundamentals
- Ability to reason about systems
- Consistent learning habits

## What This Shows
- How I break down complex topics
- How I connect concepts across domains
- How my understanding evolves over time

## Topics
- Data Engineering (Spark, SQL, ETL pipelines)
- Cloud & AWS (Glue, S3, IAM, Lambda)
- Distributed Systems
- Python & Software Fundamentals
- Machine Learning & Statistics

## Structure
- Markdown-based atomic notes
- Cross-linked concepts using Obsidian backlinks
- Practical insights from debugging and real usage

## How to View
- Directly on GitHub (Markdown files)
- Or locally in Obsidian for graph view and backlinks

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
