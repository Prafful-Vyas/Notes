	- changing the datatypes
5. how did you do unit testing
	- pytest
6. What transformations did you use as part of your project
7. SCD (slowly changing dimensions)

8. how did you do the estimation of resources required for your project?
9. what infrastructure you used? on cloud / on premise
10. how much data you deal with on a day to day basis
